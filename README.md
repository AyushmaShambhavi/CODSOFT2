# Simple Chatbot

This is a simple and friendly chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot can respond to a variety of user inputs with predefined responses. It can handle greetings, provide random advice, and engage in small talk, among other things. The bot is designed for basic conversational interaction and serves as a foundational example for building more complex natural language processing systems.

## Features

- **Basic Conversation**: The chatbot can greet users, ask about their well-being, and respond to simple queries.
- **Randomized Responses**: For certain types of queries, such as greetings or asking how the chatbot is doing, the bot provides a randomized response to make interactions more dynamic.
- **Exit Command**: Users can exit the conversation by typing "exit", "bye", or "quit".
- **Small Talk**: The bot is capable of basic small talk, like responding to "how are you?" or "I'm fine".

## How It Works

The chatbot uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to match user inputs against predefined patterns. Based on the match, it selects an appropriate response. Some responses are randomized using Python's `random.choice()` function to make the conversation feel more natural.

## Example Usage

```python
Hello! I'm your friendly chatbot. How can I help you today?
You: Hi
Chatbot: Hi there! How can I assist you today?
You: Can you give me some advice?
Chatbot: Here's some advice: Always be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
You: exit
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Running the Chatbot

Run the chatbot by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

### Exiting the Chatbot

To exit the conversation, type any of the following commands:

- `exit`
- `bye`
- `quit`

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot's responses by modifying the `chatbot()` function in the script. Add more patterns and responses to expand the chatbot's capabilities.
